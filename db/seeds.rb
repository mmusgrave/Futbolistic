real_vs_atleti="Cristiano Ronaldo once again proved himself to be the man for the big occasion as his hat-trick gave holders Real Madrid a commanding 3-0 advantage in their Champions League semi-final against city rivals Atletico Madrid.

The four-time Ballon d'Or winner has seemingly saved his best for Europe's premier competition this season, scoring five of Madrid's six goals in their pulsating quarter-final triumph over Bayern Munich, and he headed the opener after 10 minutes at a raucous Santiago Bernabeu.

Madrid's fans unveiled a huge banner celebrating the 2014 and 2016 final triumphs over their neighbours before kick-off and Ronaldo ensured the knife-edge tension of those extra-time and penalty shootout wins would be removed from this tie.

The contest fell into a familiarly fractious and cagey rhythm after the interval, but Madrid's talisman intervened to render the last European match at the Vicente Calderon a formality.

Ronaldo rifled an unstoppable shot into the top corner in the 73rd minute and claimed the matchball four minutes from time, meaning a grim catalogue of misery in this European fixture continued for Diego Simeone's side.
The hosts should have led in the seventh minute. Right-back Dani Carvajal exchanged passes with Isco and darted into the box, forcing a save from Jan Oblak before Karim Benzema was unable to turn in from close range.

It mattered little as Madrid made short work of Atletico's famously misery rearguard soon afterwards.

Benzema did well to hold up a Marcelo cross, but Ronaldo still had plenty to do with a bouncing ball and Filipe Luis in close attendance.

He steadied himself to rip a venomous strike beyond the helpless Oblak and leave Atletico staring at a bitter, localised brand of European disappointment once more – one made all the more potent when substitute Lucas Vazquez set up Ronaldo for his seventh Champions League treble."

Ajax has historically been one of the most successful clubs in the world; according to the IFFHS, Ajax were the seventh-most successful European club of the 20th century and The World's Club Team of the Year in 1992. According to German Kicker, Ajax were the second most successful European club of the 20th century. The club is one of the five teams that has earned the right to keep the European Cup and to wear a multiple-winner badge; they won consecutively in 1971–1973. In 1972, they completed the continental treble by winning the Eredivisie, KNVB Cup, and the European Cup. It also won the first organized UEFA Super Cup in 1972 against Glasgow Rangers (played in 1973). Ajax's last international trophies were the 1995 Intercontinental Cup and the 1995 Champions League, where they defeated Milan in the final; they lost the 1996 Champions League final on penalties to Juventus. In 1995, Ajax was crowned as World Team of the Year by World Soccer Magazine.

Ajax is also one of three teams to win the continental treble and the Intercontinental Cup in the same season/calendar year; This was achieved in the 1971–72 season. Ajax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, and Manchester United are the five clubs to have won all three major UEFA club competitions. They have also won the Intercontinental Cup twice, the 1991–92 UEFA Cup, as well as the Karl Rappan Cup, a predecessor of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 1962. Ajax plays at the Amsterdam Arena, which opened in 1996. They previously played at De Meer Stadion and the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium (for international matches)."
